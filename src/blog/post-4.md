When consuming content online, social media in particular, I tend to stumble upon amazing ideas.
Alas, they get lost in the endless feed of "saved" videos.

In this post I've documented some of the fun ideas that I wanted to share and perhaps try in the future!

This is part of my bigger attempt to consume more mindfully and sort out the endless "saved" folder.

You can customise the widget to show weeks or months and it works on both android and ios:

Socrates and Aristotel to Albert Camus

Be careful though - the website might not be well optimised for low end hardware
